Write a program in C that computes the nth Fibonacci number in two ways:

**Recursively**
**Iteratively**

You can hard-code the value for what n is...test it with something like 4-10 and check against the list of Fibonacci numbers here: https://oeis.org/A000045 (Links to an external site.).  Thursday I'll show you how to do console input from a user and we'll incorporate that into future assignments (it's not hard: uses a function called scanf).

For the purposes of this assignment, we'll define the first and second Fibonacci numbers to be 1, and each Fibonacci after this is the sum of the previous two.

Your program should then use printf to output both computations (which of course should be the same!).

Turn in, in a single zip/tar/gzip file:

    C source code
    aarch64 executable (generate on your pi)
    aarch64 assembly code (generate on your pi)
    aarch64 listing file (generate on your pi)
